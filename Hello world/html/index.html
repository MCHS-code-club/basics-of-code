<html> <!-- this is a HTML tag it tells the browser / computer that this is a HTML document -->

    <head> <!-- this is the head it's where most things which need to happen before the body go -->
        <title>Hello, World!</title> <!-- this is the title its what appears at the top of your browser, in favs and in search results -->
    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- this is the body of the document this is where all the
        main stuff goes like videos, text, images and basicly anything else-->
        <p>Hello, World!</p> 

        <!-- bellow is a div basicly a container for something else thats easy to work with
        inside the div is whats called an external script, this is like a link for the PC which
        lets it get code from somewhere else on your PC or the internet -->
        <div>
            <script src="https://cdn.htmlgames.com/embed.js?game=ClassicPac&amp;width=800&amp;height=480&amp;bgcolor=white"></script>
        </div>
    </body>

</html>

<!-- in html everything is in tags, tags can be inside tags inside tags inside tags ... this may
sound complex but it's really not think about a school :
schools have classes
classes have teachers
teachers have pupils 
pupils have properties and behaviours

when code is put inside other bits of code like this its called nesting like a bird within a nest
for example the body is nested within html becasue the start of the body happens before the end of
HTML

HTML isn't really that important its like the skeleton to websites most of the work we'll do will be
in javascript and CSS which are like the muscles and skin of the website respectivly -->
