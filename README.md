# basics-of-code
this is a folder full of the basics of code all the way from "Hello, World!" to functions

Hi MCHS code club! 
this folder teaches you all the basics of programing which are almost universal across every major programing language. it is full of examples, explainations and (most importantly) chalanges for you to try out. 

if you feel like something is too basic then of course feel free to skip it and try the next thing.

if you feel like something is a little bit out of reach for now 
1. dont wory about it, by learning even a smidgen of code your already better than most of the population and...
2. try a previous lesson, look for help on the internet (lets be honest google it) or ask about it in the slack chat the chances are someone else has the same or a simmilar question.

if you have finished an area but want to solidify it a bit more then you could think about how what you've learned could be applied in the real world for example if you've recently learned about inputs and know how to make a program manipulate numbers then how about making a calculator?
